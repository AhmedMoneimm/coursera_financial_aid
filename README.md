### 6. Fill this information, copy paste this
It would help me continue my dream of working in this specialization and start earning money. I am a student in Alexandria university in Egypt, and I am currently unemployed. I would like to be able to view these courses and earn a certificate, since I am still a student. The original price of this course is far too much for someone living in a Third World country such as myself. It is definitely priced way higher than what an unemployed student could afford. I really need this course to be able to compete with any other privileged person living in a first world country, while I unfortunately live in a Third World country. When factoring the conversion of currencies to EGP, you would most definitely realize that I can not possibly afford such ludicrous price. I hope you process this application as soon as possible, since I would very much like to get started learning and hope to learn a lot from this course specialization.
